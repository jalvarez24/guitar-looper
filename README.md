# Guitar Looper Project (created and tested on Raspberry Pi)
By Jayro Alvarez
# Languages/Technologies:
-C++, Bash, arecord, aplay, ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)
# Description:
The idea for my project comes from commercially available audio “loopers.” These are
devices used to record layers of audio input and then have it play back to you so you could keep
adding more layers or just use it as a backing track to improvise on top of. These commercially
available loopers can be very expensive ranging from $100 to $250 for a good quality looper.
My idea was to simulate the same basic functionality of a looper with a raspberry pi at a
significantly lower price.
# How to Use:
1. Open terminal in directory with all files
2. Compile looper.cpp file into an executable with ```sudo g++ looper.cpp```
3. Run the resulting executable with ```./a.out```
* Whenever terminal instructs to 'hit button,' it refers to return key
